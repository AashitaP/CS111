Makefile:

Supports default (builds executable), dist (builds tarball with README, Makefile and source file) and clean (removes all files including the tar.gz leaving only the three files) targets. 

lab1a.c: 

Builds a non-canonical input mode for terminal that accepts a shell option. Without the shell option, the program simply echoes what's typed in and terminates with ^D. With the shell option, it executes a shell that processes the typed input, which echoes as it is typed, and outputs the shell output until it is terminated.
