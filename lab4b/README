NAME: Aashita Patwari

lab4b.c: Source file for an embedded application that prints temperature readings and time, and accepts command line options to
change the scale, period, stop/start generating reports, log a line of text and exit the program. A button press might also cause it to shutdown. 

Makefile: Supports default (builds the executable), check(an automated smoke-test to see if the application runs and can talk to its sensors/actuators), clean (delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile) and dist (create the deliverable tarball) targets.
